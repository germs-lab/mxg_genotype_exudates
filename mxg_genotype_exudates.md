## 1. Experiment Overview

### 1.1. Objective
- **Goal:** Collect root exudates from *Miscanthus sacchariflorus*,  *M. sinensis* and *M. × giganteus* using genotype panel from Eric Sacks
- **General questions**
	- How different are these species and genotypes in term of their root exudates?
	- Do we see a correlation with biomass and yield?
	- Do we see correlation with genotypes better suited to handle chilling?
	- What does this mean for SOC?
	- While we are at it, what are the microbes doing?

### 1.2. Background
- The substantial diversity from parental lines is a source for cultivar improvement.
- Check out:

- We could use some of the previously described lines to set up a base line experiment to extract root exudates and compare. I don't know what treatments if any we should do. If we do a lot of genotypes then the comparison between them is interesting enough.

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1. Materials
-  Mischanthus rhizomes
### 2.2. Methods/Procedure
- Field?
- Greenhouse?
What are the pros and cons?
- [ ] Flesh out Mxg growing details with Nic #GERMS
- [ ] Reach out to Eric Sacks #GERMS #CABBI 
	- [ ] Are these from seeds?
	- [ ] How do they grow?
	- [ ] Who his team member there?
	- [ ] How to propagate Mx?
		- [ ] Is it seed?
		- [ ] Rhizome?
	- [ ] Growing media?
- [ ] Collect exudates at 6 and 15 weeks
