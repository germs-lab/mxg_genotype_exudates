# Mxg_genotype_exudates
## 1. Experiment Overview

### 1.1. Objective
- **Goal:** Collect root exudates from *Miscanthus sacchariflorus*,  *M. sinensis* and *M. × giganteus* using genotype panel from Eric Sacks
- **General questions**
	- How different are these species and genotypes in term of their root exudates?
	- Do we see a correlation with biomass and yield?
	- Do we see correlation with genotypes better suited to handle chilling?
	- What does this mean for SOC?
	- While we are at it, what are the microbes doing?

### 1.2. Background
- The substantial diversity from parental lines is a source for cultivar improvement.
- Check out:

	- [Njuguna et al. - 2023 - Biomass yield in a genetically diverse Miscanth](Njuguna%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Biomass%20yield%20in%20a%20genetically%20diverse%20Miscanth.pdf)
	- [Njuguna et al. - 2023 - Genome‐wide association and genomic prediction for](Njuguna%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Genome‐wide%20association%20and%20genomic%20prediction%20for.pdf)
- We could use some of the previously described lines to set up a base line experiment to extract root exudates and compare. I don't know what treatments if any we should do. If we do a lot of genotypes then the comparison between them is interesting enough.

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1. Materials
-  Mischanthus rhizomes
#### Exudate collection materials
All materials are detailed and procedures are detailed in [Materials & equipment:](mxg_exudate_collection_protocol.md#Materials%20&%20equipment)
Briefly:
#### Incubation container assembly
- Wear gloves to avoid contaminating any components. Drop a stainless steel pipe screen to the bottom of the syringe body. 
- Add ~3 mL of coarse glass beads, and re-insert the syringe plunger to hold the mesh/screen and beads in place (Figure 1).
- Cut a ~15 cm length of **NEW** tygon tubing, and attach a female Luer adaptor to one end and a male Luer adaptor to the other (Figure 2).
- Remove the plugs from the two female sockets of the three-position stopcock. 
- Attach one socket to the syringe, and the other to the Tygon tubing assembly. 
 - Leave the make socket plugged, so incubation fluid cannot accidentally drain out when operating the valve.
#### Nutrient solution stock
- Get a 1L volumetric flask and fill about ¾ths with nanopure water (in the analytical room). To this, add the following chemicals found in the chemical cabinet:
    - [ ]   0.4g NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> 
    - [ ]   0.136g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
    - [ ]   0.349g K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
    - [ ]   0.181g MgSO<sub>4</sub> (anhydrous, FW= 120.37)
    - [ ]   0.441g CaCl<sub>2</sub> (dihydrated, FW= 147.02)
### 2.2. Methods/Procedure
- [ ] Collect exudates at 6 and 15 weeks

---

### **Procedure**  

#### **Root Excavation & Cleaning**  
1. **Remove root/soil plug** from pot; excavate fine root ~2" below surface (Figure 11).  
2. **Clean roots**:  
   - Soak in water to loosen potting mix.  
   - Gently brush with paintbrush/forceps.  
   - Rinse on paper towel with squirt bottle.  
3. **Skip recovery step** (no sand burial; proceed directly to incubation).  

#### **T0: Incubation Setup**  
1. **Load root** into 20 mL syringe:  
   - Place root in syringe body, avoiding walls.  
   - Fill with alternating 1 mm/3 mm glass beads.  
   - Seal top loosely with parafilm.  
2. **Rinse** (3x with nutrient solution):  
   - Inject 10 mL (scaled down from 15 mL) via tubing with "clean" syringe.  
   - Withdraw with "dirty" syringe.  
3. **Initiate incubation**:  
   - Add 10 mL nutrient solution + 5 mL air (scaled volumes).  
   - Cover tubing end with tinfoil.  
   -Place syringe inside pot with plant.  

#### **T24: Sample Collection**  
1. **First flush (F1)**:  
   - Add 5 mL fresh solution.  
   - Withdraw solution through filter into 15 mL tube.  
2. **Second flush (F2)**:  
   - Add 10 mL fresh solution + 5 mL air.  
   - Withdraw into same tube. 
1. **Store samples** on ice packs; transfer to –80°C freezer.  

#### **Post-Collection**  
- **Root processing**:  
  - Photograph on gridded board.  
  - Dry and weigh for normalization.  
- **Controls**: Run blank (no root) and soil-contaminated controls.

### **Key Greenhouse Adaptations**  
- **Smaller assemblies**: 20 mL syringes fit pots better.  
- **No recovery step**: Roots go directly to incubation.  
- **Potting mix challenges**:  
  - Roots are more intertwined; higher tip damage risk.  
  - Reuse original pot for reassembly [image12](image12.jpeg)
- **Field soil pots**: Repot into wider containers with syringe protruding from drainage holes (Figure 14-15).  [image14](image14.jpeg)[image15](image15.jpeg)

**Time Savings**: ~1 hour/sample (vs. 3 hours in field).

## 3. Data and Observations
### 3.1 Observations
#### Planting
- Date: 2025-04-15
- Media: Sungro ss#1-f1p
	- 75-85% Canadian Sphagnum Peat moss, perlite, dolomite,lime and wetting agent.
- Pots: HC Companies 1.7 gal /6.71 L pot
- Irrigation: 
	- Single drip irrigation
- Notes: 
	- Plants were transplanted to o6.7L pots in SungGro media. Roots looked brown, potentially to do leaving overnight soaking in water. This may have caused some rot.. Dried above and belowground vegetative tissue was removed to avoid further rot or confusion of material growth.
	- Labels were kept with transplants. New labels on outer side of pots remains to be placed. 
	- Drip irrigation system is used and old. I recovered it from the greenhouse. It seems to work fine. ***Needs water timer and filter***. 

#### Transfer
- Date: 2025-04-17
- Notes: Plants were transplanted to new room in greenhouse that has better irrigation and ventilation. The new room does not ha workbenches, plants are on platform and floor level.
- Watering schedule was M/W/F/Sun for about a week. Then changed to M/Thu/Sun on 2025-04-24

#### General notes (log)
* *M. sinensis* seem to be doing fine with the watering schedule and the replanting stressed it incurred. On the other hand, *M. sacchariflorus* does not seem to be putting out new rhizomes. I am concerned the transplanting and watering schedule (it was too wet for a couple of days at the the beginning of their stay at Grinnell/ISU post two day dry period).
* **2025-29-04**: Reduce the watering schedule to Monday and Friday only. I see signs of rot in *M. sacchariflorus* and some *M. sinensis* individuals.
* **2025-05-01**: I inspected some of the *M. sacchariflorus* plants more carefully and they seem to have rot. I uprooted *M. sacchariflorus* 4x PMS-457 and noted that most if not all of the root were dry or rotted. I also uprooted another genorype, (will add ID here soon) and observed the same. It is likely most of the sacchariflorus will not survive.
* **2025-05-03**: Added 30mL of Osmocote 17-5-11 fertilizer to each pot. Checked for growth on seemingly dead plants. some of them are alive. The rhizomes should come out soon. 

#### Fertilization
From Erik Sacks:

| Container size | Application: Osmocote to Add to Pot |
| :--------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
| 1 gal.         | 1 tblsp                             |
| 2 gals.        | 2 heaping tblsp                     |
| 5 gals.        | 1/3 cup                             |
| 10 gals.       | 2/3 cup                             |

**Incubation setup (T0) notes**

**T-24 notes:**
>[!note]
>**Note from Bolívar**: During the exudate collection from *Miscanthus spp*. at Iowa State University, we found that for collecting samples in the greenhouse:
>- Watering the plants the day before ensured healthy plants at the day of collections they seemed to fair well after the disturbance caused by the un-potting and re-potting.
>- Inserting the nutrient stock solution into the incubation assembly needs to be delicate, if not the pressure from the liquid can push the metal filter, flip-it and cause 1 mm beads to enter the tygon tube which clogs it and causes a lot of trouble. Be easy with this!
>- Potentially, the metal filter can be cut with a low tolerant so as to fit snug in the barrel of the syringe and not be susceptible to liquid pressure. 
>- PVDF syringe filters (0.22 micron membrane) seem to work better one-way. They can expel liquid fine, but not so much intake. When collecting sample, if the solution has debris that the metal filter did not eliminate it can clog up easily and be troublesome for expelling the sample liquid into the collection vial. Have extra filter in hand to change accordingly. 
>- A work around for the syringe filter working better one-way was to assemble the syringe and filter in the 3-way stopcock effectively using all three intakes. You can insert the liquid via on side into the incubation syringe, collect back to the working syringe, invert the flow of the stopcock to to allow expulsion though the PVDF filter in to the collection vial. See figure below.
>- Some of the samples suffered more disturbance than others. Main the first two done. I can't recall which one they were but it reflects our lack of familiarity with the protocol.
