## 1. Experiment Overview

### 1.1. Objective
- **Goal:** Learn how to grow Miscanthus x giganteus in greenhouse for extraction of root exudates
- **Hypothesis:** Little Mxg will germinate from 8 month old rhizomes

### 1.2. Background
- No one at ISU is currently growing Mxg in a greenhouse.
- It imperative to grow some in controlled conditions and learn how to extract root exudates. Mainly to flesh out the protocol. 
- [John Field](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/john-l-field) at Oak Ridge National laboratory has an excellent protocol for extracting exudates from *Poplar*, see [LDRD_Root_Exudates_Protocol-v6.docx](LDRD_Root_Exudates_Protocol-v6.docx).
	- I'm modifying this protocol here: [mxg_exudate_collection_protocol](mxg_exudate_collection_protocol.md)

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1. Materials
- See [Materials & equipment](mxg_exudate_collection_protocol.md#Materials%20&%20equipment)
- As of 2025-02-06, I need to acquire: 
	- Materials in [2.1. Materials](pilot_mxg_greenhouse.md#2.1.%20Materials)

- For Mxg rhizome preparation:
	- Mxg rhizomes available in walk-in fridge
	- Buckets
	- Plastic boxes
	- DI H<sub>2</sub>O
	- Razor blades
	- gloves
- For Mxg rhizome growing:
	- Potting soil
	- [ ] Pots -> which pots? #GERMS #lab_entry #mxg_pilot
### 2.2. Methods/Procedure
  1. **Preparation:** 
	  1. Mxg rhizomes:
		- Select "healthiest" rhizomes
			  - Live axillary buds
		- Rinse rhizomes with DI H<sub>2</sub>O
			- Maybe 10% bleach solution for 60 seconds, then DI water? #mxg_pilot #CABBI 
		- Dry with paper towels
		- Remove dead rhizome material
		- Cut-out best buds
		- Soak 24-72 hrs in Di water to "revive"
		- Place soaked rhizomes in heating pad to get water to 75-85 °F
		- [ ] Cover with clear lid? #CABBI #mxg_pilot 
  
  1. **Execution:** 
  Followed steps described above. I used white tubs in GERMS lab to soak rhizomes in solution.
- Soaked rhizomes in tap water to clean-ff
- Rinsed in 10% bleach for ~60 seconds
- Rinsed in RO H<sub>2</sub>O 
- Dried
- Cut-off dead and "non-promising" parts
Mxg rhizomes where place in about 1 inch of RO H<sub>2</sub>O in plastic tub. Placed over a plant heating pad. Heating pad should keep temperature at ~80 °F. Red lights were turned on and set at ~17 hrs ON and ~7hrs OFF.

*  **2025-02-11**
	- H<sub>2</sub>O was changed at 11 hrs.
	- Rhizomes look good. Not much nascent buds, but still hopeful.
- **2025-02-14**
	- Removed from H<sub>2</sub>O
	- Some rhizomes had mold mycelium.
  1. **Cleanup:** Mention post-experiment procedures if applicable.
- **Notes:** Add any specific instructions or deviations from the standard protocol.

## 3. Data and Observations

### 3.1. Observations
- Record qualitative observations made during the experiment (e.g., color changes, smells, unexpected events).

### 3.2. Data Collection
- **Data Table:**

| Sample | Measurement | Unit | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------|-------|
|        |             |      |       |
|        |             |      |       |

- **Additional Data:**  
  - Insert any graphs, images, or sketches.  
  - You can embed images in Obsidian using: `![[image-file.png]]`



## 4. Results
- Summarize the quantitative and qualitative results.
- Include any calculations or statistical analyses if applicable.


## 5. Analysis and Discussion
- Interpret the results. What do they imply about your hypothesis?
- Discuss any potential errors, anomalies, or unexpected outcomes.
- Consider how the findings compare to previous work or theoretical expectations.


## 6. Conclusion
- Summarize the major findings.
- State whether the experiment supported the hypothesis.
- Highlight the significance of the results.


## 7. Next Steps / Future Work
- Outline any follow-up experiments or modifications to the procedure.
- Identify any new questions that have arisen.

## 8. References
- List all sources, literature, or protocols referenced in your experiment.
