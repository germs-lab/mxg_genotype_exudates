1. Rooted the poplar cuttings, then moved them into a silica sand for 3-4 weeks with Hoaglands growth medium  (I think you could do this step hydroponically If preferred)
2. For exudate collection, we harvested the plants from the sand, rinsed off the roots to remove sand, and placed the plants in a 50 ml falcon tube with15 ml pure water for 24 hours. We defined the exudate as any metabolites exuded into the water during this period.  We then removed the plant, centrifuged the solution to remove any remaining sand and freeze-dried it.  The exudate was then resuspended in 250 ul and processed using LC or GC/MS.
