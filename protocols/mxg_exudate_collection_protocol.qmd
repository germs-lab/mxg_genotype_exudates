# Overview

This protocol is designed for the collection of soluble root exudates
*in situ* in field or greenhouse settings to support measurement of
exudation rate and chemistry/ metabolomics. In brief, fine roots are
carefully excavated from the soil, allowed to recover, then incubated in
a dilute nutrient salt solution for approximately one day. Exudate
samples are recovered by flushing fresh nutrient solution through the
incubation assembly; flush solution samples are then collected,
filtered, frozen, and returned to the lab for measurement of total
organic carbon (TOC) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
chemical analysis. In addition, the incubated roots are recovered,
scanned, and weighed in order to normalize the rate of exudation against
the root mass, volume, surface area, etc.

There are only very limited examples of field root exudate collection
for metabolomic analysis in the existing literature, and associated
methods vary widely. This protocol was modified from Phillips et al.
2008. *Functional Ecology* 22(6) 990–999 by Rose Abramoff, and
subsequent changes were informed by an informal literature review
conducted by Abramoff and John Field, summarized here:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1knX6Bz8RmeoAcph9IfCfVKZadpAyQil7qGnWULf8sH0/edit#gid=0>.
Changes from the original Phillips et al. 2008 protocol include
simplifications designed to save time or costs, to better support
metabolomic analysis, and to improve safety. There are several
considerations in past and ongoing protocol adaptation and optimization:

-   **Protection of root function—** The goal of this protocol is to
    collect exudates from roots *in situ* (in the field or from potted
    plants in the greenhouse) while minimizing disturbances that could
    change the rate or chemistry of exudation and rhizodeposition.
    Initial root excavation from the field soil or greenhouse potting
    mix should be done very carefully to minimize abrasion and/or
    breakage of root tips—***this is typically the most labor-intensive
    part of the protocol by far***. The protocol includes a
    rest/recovery step between excavation and incubation to allow the
    roots to recover from that disturbance and return to equilibrium
    function. Once roots are carefully placed in incubation assemblies,
    those containers are backfilled with glass beads to mimic physical
    structure of soil and provide some air-filled pore space for gas
    exchange. Also, this protocol follows the original Phillips et al.
    method of incubating the live roots in a mild nutrient salt
    solution, to keep a realistic osmotic balance and stimulate solution
    uptake by the roots. This contrasts with some more recent exudate
    metabolomic studies that sterilize the roots prior to incubation
    and/or incubate them in pure DI water. DI water collection would be
    compatible with GC–MS analysis in the Tschaplinski lab, but the
    salty nutrient solution requires LC–MS analysis (Paul Abraham).

-   **Contamination & controls—** This protocol is meant to support
    collection of root exudates, rather than root biomass, soil, or
    other contaminants. The protocol involves multiple rinsing steps to
    remove soil from roots, and to flush any remaining soil or other
    contaminants from the incubation assemblies. Exudate samples are
    also filtered to remove any particulate contaminants prior to
    analysis. While utilizing acid-washed glass incubation containers
    and other components would be ideal for avoiding any leaching of
    carbon-containing compounds from the incubation assemblies into the
    exudate samples, cost and time considerations require the use of
    plastic components. ***The glass beads used to mimic soil structure
    should ideally be acid-washed prior to use.*** In addition, controls
    samples should be collected to better characterize and correct for
    potential contamination. Nutrient solution control samples with and
    without intentional soil contamination should be collected during
    any field sampling campaign. Future protocol optimization should
    attempt to quantify potential sources of contamination, particularly
    from the polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) syringe filters used for
    filtering these samples. Nutrient blank solutions collected during
    the initial Clatskanie field campaign showed \~2 ppm TOC,
    significant compared to the main F1 (6–45 ppm TOC, median=13ppm) and
    F2 flush samples (2–14 ppm TOC, median=5).

-   **Sample storage & preservation—** We generally store samples
    collected in the field on ice packs (“blue ice”) in a cooler, until
    they can be put into a –80C freezer back at the lab. Some secondary
    metabolites (e.g., auxin) present in root biomass and exudates are
    short-lived, and capturing those transient compounds would require
    immediate and continuous ultra-cold handling and storage. Also, Tim
    Tschaplinski and Nancy Engle have observed hydrolytic activity
    during insufficiently cold sample storage that leads to loss of
    oligosaccharides and complex phenolics in favor of greater
    monosaccharides and cleaved aromatics. The nature of this exudate
    collection method—i.e., day-long incubation at ambient
    temperature—makes such transformations inevitable. However, if fine
    root biomass is collected at the same time for metabolomic analysis,
    it is recommended those samples be stored on dry ice immediately
    (requires additional training and planning steps). Note that glass
    scintillation vials will likely crack during –80C storage, and
    plastic centrifuge tubes will crack if over-filled. Care should be
    taken to order deep-freeze-friendly sample storage containers, and
    not to over-fill them.

-   **Miscellaneous considerations—** The protocol below tries to
    minimize the “dead” volume of incubation solution that is not in
    contact with roots by using narrow tubing. Luer lock components and
    parafilm (rather than the plastic stoppers described by Phillips et
    al.) are used where possible to keep a closed system and minimize
    soil contact with incubation assemblies. For simplicity we have
    generally adopted three initial rinse steps to remove any
    contaminants from the incubation assemblies (rather than the 5 done
    by Phillips et al.) and two flush steps to recover exudates (rather
    than the 3 they recommend). The original protocol relied on using
    needles to transfer exudate solution samples into evacuated glass
    sample vials, but this introduces puncture risks, and glass vial
    tend to crack during –80C storage prior to metabolomic analysis. To
    avoid these issues, we have modified the protocol to transfer
    samples directly to 15 mL plastic conical tubes, though this
    introduces an additional opportunity for soil contamination of the
    samples.

This protocol has been utilized in both field and greenhouse settings.
Abramoff, Field, and Sarah Ottinger sampled \~50 mature back cottonwood
trees (*Populus trichocarpa*) at the CBI GWAS site in Clatskanie, Oregon
in mid-October, 2022. In addition, Field, Udaya Kalluri, and Tommy Mead
further modified the protocol to collect exudates from 20 trees grown in
the APPL greenhouse in early June, 2024.

# Time requirements

-   This is ideally a minimum three-day field protocol. On the first
    day, a fine root bunch is carefully excavated, and then allowed to
    recover in moist sand for a day. On the second day, the roots are
    loaded into incubation assemblies, rinsed, and a day-long incubation
    is initiated. On the third day the incubation solution is recovered.

-   During the Clatskanie field campaign, it took 3 people about (6)
    8-hour days to collect \~50 samples, or **\~3 hours per sample**.
    This time was especially long because dry conditions made excavation
    slow, we were very conservative about root tracing and minimizing
    root damage, and the disperse site required a lot of walking between
    the trees being sampled.

-   During the APPL greenhouse campaign, it took an average of two
    people (2) 5-hour days to collect 20 samples, or **\~1 hour per
    sample**. In this case, root excavation was relatively quick
    compared to the field, and the root recovery step was skipped
    entirely due to impracticality and lack of time.

# Materials & equipment

## PPE

-   Gloves—several pairs per person per day, in the appropriate sizes
    (should be used any time plant material that could have been exposed
    to fertilizers or pesticides is handled)

-   Bug spray

-   Sunscreen

-   Gardening pads (to make extended kneeling more comfortable)

-   Tarp (to separate from wet ground and insects)

-   Plenty of drinking water \### Tools for excavation

-   Hand trowels

-   Assortment of tweezers

-   Small paintbrushes (for brushing soil particles from fine roots)

-   Marker flags (one per tree to be sampled)

-   Flagging tape

-   Pie tins (2 per plant)

-   Sand (\~1/2 pound(?) per tree sampled; used in root recovery step)

-   Tap water in squirt bottles (for rinsing roots, and rinsing gloves
    and other components to minimize soil contamination)

-   Paper towels (for blotting roots and general cleaning)

-   5-gallon buckets (for collecting waste sand and other trash) \###
    Incubation assembly One assembly per plant sampled, plus several
    extra to collect <u>control samples</u>. Quantities listed below are
    *per plant sampled*:

    -   

        (2) 30 mL plastic Luer lock syringes (used for root incubation
            and solution flushing/collection), plus addition

        -   Greenhouse variation described below calls for smaller 20 mL
            syringes due to space constraints and smaller root sizes;
            see below

    -   Mesh or screen material to prevent glass beads from clogging
        syringe port

        -   The original protocol used mesh fabric cut in disks or
            folded into cones
        -   Stainless steel pipe screens greatly simplify set-up and
            improve reliability

-   Glass beads

    -   3 mm coarse beads (\~15 mL / 1 oz) to take up space
    -   1 mm fine beads (\~15 mL / 1 oz) to provide more realistic
        support and porosity
        -   Phillips et al. used 750 μm diameter
        -   1 lb of beads = 215 mL; 15 mL = 0.07 lb = 1.1 oz.
        -   Stored in squirt bottles for easier pouring
        -   [It is difficult to get good mixing between the 1mm and 3mm
            beads in the incubation assemblies. We should consider using
            1mm beads only, or a slightly smaller size instead of 1mm,
            or layering the two sizes more carefully while filling the
            incubation syringe.]{.mark}

-   

    (1) syringe filter (PVDF, 33mm diameter, 0.22 μm pore size)

    -   We should explore this as a potential source of TOC
        contamination, and potentially test alternative materials,
        and/or pre-rinsing the filters.

-   

    (1) three-position stopcock

    -   Facilitates rinsing and flushing, recovering of all solution

-   15 cm of 1/16” inner diameter Tygon tubing

    -   This narrow tubing size minimizes dead volume in the assembly

-   Barb adaptors—(1) female Luer to 1/16” barb and (1) male Luer
    to1/16” barb

-

    -   **Optional**– When working at remote field sites, nutrient
        solution can be prepared and shipped in a 10x concentrated form,
        and then diluted down in the field. Doing so requires a source
        of distilled water and a plastic graduated cylinder.

## **Note from John Field:** 
Make sure that the containers
are rated for extreme low temperatures, and are over-sized relative to
the expected volume of solution. - ***It may be justified to pool both
F1 and F2 samples into a single 50 mL conical sample tube instead, to
limit the number of TOC and LC–MS measurements required.***

envelopes for storing/drying incubated roots back at the lab

## Preparation:

### Incubation container assembly

-   Wear gloves to avoid contaminating any components. Drop a stainless
    steel pipe screen to the bottom of the syringe body.
-   Add \~3 mL of coarse glass beads, and re-insert the syringe plunger
    to hold the mesh/screen and beads in place (Figure 1).
-   Cut a \~15 cm length of **NEW** tygon tubing, and attach a female
    Luer adaptor to one end and a male Luer adaptor to the other (Figure
    2).
-   Remove the plugs from the two female sockets of the three-position
    stopcock.
-   Attach one socket to the syringe, and the other to the Tygon tubing
    assembly.
-   Leave the make socket plugged, so incubation fluid cannot
    accidentally drain out when operating the valve. \#### Nutrient
    solution stock
-   Get a 1L volumetric flask and fill about ¾ths with nanopure water
    (in the analytical room). To this, add the following chemicals found
    in the chemical cabinet:
    -   0.4g NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>
    -   0.136g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
    -   0.349g K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
    -   0.181g MgSO<sub>4</sub> (anhydrous, FW= 120.37)
    -   0.441g CaCl<sub>2</sub> (hydrated, FW= 147.02)

:::{.callout-note} 
**Note from John Field:** 
Put a stirbar (in a jar above the balances) in the flask and stir until everything has dissolved. Filter
the solution with a vacuum Erlenmeyer flask and the glass filtering
apparatus. Filters for this are the 47mm ones. Store the stock
solution in a plastic Nalgene in the refrigerator.
:::
-   To make the working nutrient solution for the field, dilute the
    stock 10x (i.e., 100ml stock + 900 ml nanopure water). Store working
    solution in the refrigerator when not using it. 

### Acid wash the
    glass beads
-   Use a vacuum filter flask assembly and 10% HCl (same as in Building
    1505 Lab 271 acid bath)

:::{.callout-note} 
## **Note from John Field:** 
We currently use sterile syringes,
tubing, stopcocks, etc. straight from the package, without any washing
step. Gloves should be worn when handling those components to avoid
contamination. 
:::

### Sample container labeling - Once the sample
collection plan is established, create labels for: - The 30 mL
syringes used in the incubation assemblies - The F1 and F2 sample
tubes 
- Coin envelopes for storing/drying the fine roots recovered
from the incubation apparatus - Plastic baggies for soil moisture
samples - Any whirl bags for fine root samples

# Collecting exudate samples
## Root excavation, cleaning & recovery:

This is the most painstaking and time-consuming step in the process.
Root excavation and cleaning in the field can take an hour or more,
particularly when conditions are dry and the soil is firm. Note that if
you are attempting to sample individual trees in a common garden
setting, it is ***essential*** to trace roots out from the target tree,
since there will likely be large amounts of root intermingling. A good
fine root bunch should include multiple live (light-colored and firm)
branches, with root tips intact, over a length of 3–5 inches (Figure 4).
It is common to start excavating multiple candidate fine roots, only to
find that they are unacceptable (e.g., too short, or damaged, or diving
too deep into the soil), before completing a successful excavation of an
appropriate fine root bunch.

-   **Excavation—** Use flagging tape to mark the tree being sampled.
    Scrape any litter layer or live groundcover away from the plant
    stem. Dig near the plant stem to identify a wide radial root, and
    follow it until a live fine root (2mm or less in diameter branches
    off) is found. Take extreme care to avoid damaging any of the
    upstream root system, or sever the fine root being excavated. Use
    tweezers and your fingers to follow and gently excavate the roots
    branching out from that fine root, until the entire root bunch is
    completely excavated. Sometimes a hand trowel can be used to dig out
    the soil beyond when you estimate the end of the root bunch lies,
    and then excavating backwards toward the target root. This is a very
    delicate process, and you should use your fingers to tug at the fine
    roots, but minimize force so that you don’t break off the fine root
    tips (hot-spots for exudation?). Use a flag to mark the approximate
    position of the excavated root.

-   **Cleaning—** Using forceps, gently clean organic material and soil
    from the root. It can also be helpful to soak the root in a foil pan
    filled with water. We usually finish the cleaning by rinsing the
    root on a paper towel with a tap water squirt bottle. Figure 4 shows
    an example cleaned root bunch. Record any notes on the root in the
    field notebook.

-   **Recovery—** Once the root is clean, dig a depression and place a
    foil pan with holes in the bottom in the depression (if you have
    extra time, you can dig this hole out deeper, approximately the
    depth of the cuvette standing on end, to prepare for day 2). Cover
    the bottom of the pan with sand-soil mix from the bucket and place
    the root on top of this. Fill the pan the rest of the way with
    sand-soil mix. Put some sand-soil mix on where the root enters the
    pan just outside of the pan to help you identify where the root
    coming from when you take it out of the pan a few days later.
    Liberally squirt tap water over the top of the sand-soil mix until
    it is fully saturated. The excavated root should ideally now be
    completely covered in moist sand (Figure 5). Place another inverted
    foil pan on top to protect from heat and evaporation, and sprinkle
    leaf litter on top of the pan to hide it from curious animals.

### Time Zero - T0
#### Loading roots into the incubation assembly, rinsing, and initiating the incubation

This step should be initiated only after the excavated roots have spent
one or more days recovering in the sand-soil mix. Before beginning, take
two new 30 mL syringes, and label one “clean” and the other “dirty”, to
be used for supplying and withdrawing rinse solution to and from the
incubation assemblies. These clean and dirty syringes can be re-used for
rinsing out multiple incubation assemblies, though you should replace
the “clean” syringe if the tip or barrel becomes obviously contaminated
with soil.

-   Carefully remove the leaf litter from on top of the foil pan and
    scoop the root out of the moist sand-soil mixture. Dump the foil pan
    and sand-soil mix back into the waste bucket. Place the root in a
    foil pan without holes in it and soak it in tap water. Then transfer
    it to a paper towel and rinse it with a squirt bottle and use
    forceps to get the rest of the sand-soil mix off.

-   If you didn’t do this at the initial excavation stage, use the
    trowel to dig a deep hole for the incubation assembly to sit as
    upright as possible in.

-   **Load root into the incubation assembly—** Remove the plunger from
    the incubation syringe and discard. Be sure to keep the syringe
    assembly upright so the beads and mesh/screen don’t fall out. Place
    the clean fine root bunch into the syringe body, ideally away from
    the walls (Figure 6). For longer roots, you may have to gently fold
    them over to fit within the syringe body. Fill the rest of the
    syringe volume with glass beads, alternating between layers of
    coarse (3mm) and fine (1mm) beads, and gently tapping the syringe
    body so that the beads settle in with minimum voids (Figure 7). Use
    parafilm to cover the open top of the syringe body around the root.
    The parafilm should be extensive enough to keep soil and other
    contaminants out of the incubation apparatus, but not air-tight
    (since we will need to inject and withdraw solution from the
    assembly, and to avoid putting too much pressure on the root).


-   **Rinse—** Use the “clean” syringe to inject 15 mL of nutrient
    solution through the tubing and stopcock into the incubation syringe
    body (from the bottom; Figure 8), and close the stopcock. Disconnect
    the “clean” syringe and connect the “dirty” syringe. Open the
    stopcock, and suck out the rinse solution. Rinse solution can be
    discarded onto the ground away from the excavated root, or down the
    drain in the 1503 headhouse. Repeat this process two more time, for
    a total of (3) 15 mL rinses. To reduce waste and costs, these
    “clean” and “dirty” syringes can be re-used multiple times, provided
    they don’t get mixed up, and the clean syringe doesn’t become
    visually contaminated.

-   **Initiate the incubation—** Add 10 mL of nutrient solution to the
    incubation assembly. Using the same “clean” syringe,
    <span class="mark">inject 5 mL of air into the bottom of the
    assembly to help distribute the incubation solution evenly through
    the incubation assembly.</span> Close the stopcock, remove the
    injection syringe, and cover the end of the tubing with tinfoil to
    keep soil out of the assembly (Figure 9).

-   Record the time, the amount of incubation solution added, and any
    notes in the log book.

-   Take a large piece of foil and wrap it around the front of the
    cuvette to keep the root out of the light. Put a pie tray and/or
    leaf litter on top of the assembly to protect it from the sun and
    from curious animals.

### Time 24 - T24

Roots should incubate for approximately 24 ± 2 hours. Since some of the
original incubation solution will have been taken up by the roots,
additional solution must be added to mobilize and “flush” the remaining
solution and any exuded compounds out of the incubation assembly for
recovery. Two separate flushes are performed, to maximize the recovery
of soluble exudates accumulated in the incubation assemblies. Note that
a fresh 30 mL syringe should be used to collect the flushes from each
plant sampled to prevent cross-contamination, but the collection syringe
can be re-used for the first and second flushes.

-   Record the time that the incubation is terminated (this will allow
    calculation of the total incubation time), and uncover the
    incubation assembly.

-   **First flush (F1)—** Using the “clean” syringe, add 5 mL of fresh
    nutrient solution through the bottom of the incubation assembly.
    Make sure to close the stopcock when switching between the injection
    and sampling syringes, so the solution does not drain out
    unintentionally. Then, using a fresh 30 mL syringe dedicated to
    collecting samples from this particular plant, withdraw as much of
    the incubation solution as possible. Disconnect the sampling syringe
    from the incubation assembly, holding it upside-down, so none of the
    flush solution leaks out during the transfer. Attach a syringe
    filter to the end of the sample syringe, and squirt the solution to
    the appropriately-labeled (F1) 15 mL conical sample tube (Figure
    10). Be careful not to transfer any soil into the sample tube from
    dirty gloves or other sources. Record an estimate of the volume and
    color of the solution (e.g., no color, light yellow, yellow, dark
    yellow).

:::{.callout-note}
Earlier versions of this protocol called for using a
        needle to transfer the solutions to evacuated glass sample tubes
        with septa. While that minimized any potential for soil
        contamination at the sample transfer stage, it also introduced a
        sharps hazard, and glass sample tubes are problematic for
        ultra-cold storage.
:::
-   **Second flush (F2)—** Using the “clean” syringe, add 10 mL working
    nutrient solution through the bottom of the incubation assembly, and
    the <span class="mark">inject 5 mL of air to help distribute the
    solution evenly.</span> Make sure to close the stopcock when
    switching between the injection and sampling syringes, so the
    solution does not drain out unintentionally. Then, using the
    sampling syringe from the first flush, withdraw as much of the
    incubation solution as possible. Disconnect the sampling syringe
    from the incubation assembly, holding it upside-down, so none of the
    flush solution leaks out during the transfer. Attach a syringe
    filter to the end of the sample syringe (the filter from the F1
    flush can be re-used, if it is not plugged up), and squirt the
    solution to the appropriately-labeled (F2) 15 mL conical sample
    tube. Be careful not to transfer any soil into the sample tube from
    dirty gloves or other sources. Record an estimate of the volume and
    color of the solution (e.g., no color, light yellow, yellow, dark
    yellow).

-   **Storage—** Transfer the F1 and F2 sample tubes to the cooler with
    ice packs (“blue ice”).

    -   <span class="mark">In the future, we may switch to storage on
        dry ice (which requires additional safety protocols and
        planning).</span>

-   Cut the incubated root about an inch away from syringe body, and
    place the incubation assembly upright in a box to bring it back to
    the lab.

### Controls & other measurements:

For every several incubations, control samples should be collected. In
those cases, two additional incubation assemblies should be set up
alongside the main incubation. These controls should be assembled and
flushed just like a true incubation, but without the addition of a fine
root bunch. In the “soil” control, intentionally add a small soil
particle to the assembly before closing it with parafilm. After 24 hours
of incubation, recover F1 and F2 flush samples, then discard the
(root-less) incubation assemblies.

-   **Soil moisture—** Exudation rates and chemistry are strongly
    affected by soil moisture condition. To better account for this, it
    is recommended to collect a spade-full of soil from the wall of the
    hole you have excavated into a labeled plastic baggie, for
    measurement of gravimetric water content back at the lab.

-   **Fine roots—** At the time of exudate sampling, consider also
    collecting additional fine roots biomass samples for chemical or
    metabolic analysis. This provides an opportunity for comparison of
    the root biomass vs. exudate metabolomic profiles, or other
    analysis. If the root biomass will be used for metabolomic analysis,
    it should ideally be stored on dry ice immediately after collection.

# Processing back at the lab

-   Put all exudate flush samples in –80C freezer until hand-off for
    LC–MS and TOC measurement

-   **Incubation disassembly—** Remove the parafilm and gently pour the
    root and glass beads into a tub. If it doesn’t slide right out,
    squirt some water into the cuvette to help it come out. Rinse the
    beads off the root using a nanopure squirt bottle. Place the root
    and ID tape on the piece of Styrofoam board with centimeters marked
    on two sides, and photograph. Then store in labeled coin envelopes.

-   **Root characterization—** Work with Larry York to scan each
    incubated root sample and analyze with Rhizovision Explorer. Put the
    wet roots back into labeled coin envelopes, then dry and weigh them.

# Greenhouse sampling

This protocol was modified to collect exudate samples from poplar plants
grown in the ORNL APPL greenhouse over a ~4 week period in May 2024.
This experiment included plants grown in both potting mix and field
soils. In both cases we removed the root/soil “plugs” from the original
pots, excavated a fine root ~2 inches below the surface from the side
(Figure 11); and set up our root incubation assembly below the soil
surface. We down-sized from 30 mL down to 20 mL syringes for the
incubation assembly, in order to accommodate the less well-developed
roots and to better fit inside the greenhouse pots. All rinse and flush
volumes should be scaled down accordingly. Note that root disturbance is
relatively high in this greenhouse sampling, since the roots were highly
intertwined, and the excavation affects a much larger fraction of the
plant’s total root biomass. We sacrificed off-target roots to excavate
target ones as needed, but even then, our target roots suffered from a
relatively high rate of tip-snapping during excavation.

Also, we didn’t have sufficient time or a practical
method for implementing a root rest/recovery step, so we skipped this
step in the initial trial. In future greenhouse collections, a two-step
incubation process is recommended, so that the roots can rest/recover
during the first incubation, and then the true samples of interest can
be collected from the second incubation.

-   **Potting mix—** It was moderately difficult to rinse potting mix
    from the roots. Root/potting mix “plugs” tended to stay intact after
    removal as once piece (Figure 11). Incubation assembly could thus be
    buried within the existing plug, and the whole bundle reassembled
    into the original pot (Figure 12). Additional tubing length is
    required to run back out the top of the pots (Figure 13), which
    introduces additional “dead” volume. In future iterations, we could
    consider putting holes in the sides of pots for better access to the
    incubation assemblies.

-   **Field soil—** It was relatively easy to isolate and rinse the
    roots. However, the lack of “plug” structure meant there was nothing
    to anchor the incubation assemble to during reassembly. Instead, we
    re-potted these plants in wide circular pots, with the incubation
    syringes protruding from drainage holes at the bottom (Figure 14;
    Figure 15). Doing so required heavy disturbance of the remaining
    root plug (loosening and folding it) to make it fit properly in the
    new pot shape, while positioning the incubation assembly
    appropriately. All plants suffered from some wilting during the
    incubation assembly set-up, but these field soil plants took
    significantly longer to perk back up after watering.

## **Note from John Field**
In our initial trial, I did not down-scale the volumes, and I erroneously skipped the 5 mL new solution addition for the F1 flush, so we’ll probably just pool our  F1 and F2 samples together for analysis.

# Working with *Miscanthus spp.*

This protocol was followed almost to the letter for collecting exudates from *Miscanthus sinensis* plants grown in the greenhouse at Iowa State University. We used glass syringes for the control incubation assemblies, and fine (25 µm)stainless steel screens to block glass beads from clogging the syringe nozzle. The incubation assemblies were set up in a similar manner to the poplar plants. We too skipped the moist sand recovery step for our greenhouse collection. 

Some general considerations for collecting samples in the greenhouse:

- Watering the plants the day before ensured healthy plants at the day of collections they seemed to fair well after the disturbance caused by the un-potting and re-potting.
- Inserting the nutrient stock solution into the incubation assembly needs to be delicate, if not the pressure from the liquid can push the metal filter, flip-it and cause 1 mm beads to enter the tygon tube which clogs it and causes a lot of trouble. Be easy with this!
- Potentially, the metal filter can be cut with a low tolerant so as to fit snug in the barrel of the syringe and not be susceptible to liquid pressure. 
- PVDF syringe filters (0.22 micron membrane) seem to work better one-way. They can expel liquid fine, but not so much intake. When collecting sample, if the solution has debris that the metal filter did not eliminate it can clog up easily and be troublesome for expelling the sample liquid into the collection vial. Have extra filter in hand to change accordingly. 
- A work around for the syringe filter working better one-way was to assemble the syringe and filter in the 3-way stopcock effectively using all three intakes. You can insert the liquid via on side into the incubation syringe, collect back to the working syringe, invert the flow of the stopcock to to allow expulsion though the pVDF filter in to the collection vial. See figure below.

## Appendix 3 {.appendix}

### **Greenhouse Root Exudate Collection Protocol**

*(Modified and shortened from field protocol for potted plants)*

#### **Materials Needed**

**Excavation Tools**\
- Hand trowel\
- Fine forceps\
- Small paintbrush\
- Squirt bottle (tap water)\
- Paper towels\
- 5-gallon bucket (waste)

**Incubation Assembly (Per Plant)**\
- 20 mL Luer lock syringes (downsized from 30 mL)\
- Stainless steel mesh screen (30 µm)\
- Glass beads (1 mm and 3 mm)\
- PVDF syringe filter (0.22 µm)\
- 15 cm Tygon tubing (1/16" ID)\
- 3-way stopcock, Luer adapters\
- Parafilm, tinfoil

**Solutions & Storage**\
- Dilute nutrient salt solution (scaled down volumes)\
- 15 mL conical tubes (freeze-proof)\
- Cooler with ice packs



### **Procedure**

#### **Root Excavation & Cleaning**

1.  **Remove root/soil plug** from pot; excavate fine root \~2" below
    surface (Figure 11).\
2.  **Clean roots**:
    -   Soak in water to loosen potting mix.\
    -   Gently brush with paintbrush/forceps.\
    -   Rinse on paper towel with squirt bottle.\
3.  **Skip recovery step** (no sand burial; proceed directly to
    incubation).

#### **T0: Incubation Setup**

1.  **Load root** into 20 mL syringe:
    -   Place root in syringe body, avoiding walls.\
    -   Fill with alternating 1 mm/3 mm glass beads.\
    -   Seal top loosely with parafilm.\
2.  **Rinse** (3x with nutrient solution):
    -   Inject 10 mL (scaled down from 15 mL) via tubing with "clean"
        syringe.\
    -   Withdraw with "dirty" syringe.\
3.  **Initiate incubation**:
    -   Add 10 mL nutrient solution + 5 mL air (scaled volumes).\
    -   Cover tubing end with tinfoil.\
        -Place syringe inside pot with plant.

#### **T24: Sample Collection**

1.  **First flush (F1)**:
    -   Add 5 mL fresh solution.\
    -   Withdraw solution through filter into 15 mL tube.\
2.  **Second flush (F2)**:
    -   Add 10 mL fresh solution + 5 mL air.\
    -   Withdraw into same tube.
3.  **Store samples** on ice packs; transfer to –80°C freezer.

#### **Post-Collection**

-   **Root processing**:
    -   Photograph on gridded board.\
    -   Dry and weigh for normalization.\
-   **Controls**: Run blank (no root) and soil-contaminated controls.


### **Key Greenhouse Adaptations**

-   **Smaller assemblies**: 20 mL syringes fit pots better.\
-   **No recovery step**: Roots go directly to incubation.\
-   **Potting mix challenges**:
    -   Roots are more intertwined; higher tip damage risk.\
    -   Reuse original pot for reassembly [image12](image12.jpeg)
-   **Field soil pots**: Re-pot into wider containers with syringe
    protruding from drainage holes (Figure 14-15).
    [image14](image14.jpeg)[image15](image15.jpeg)

**Time Savings**: \~1 hour/sample (vs. 3 hours in field).
